# Part I: Enrollment rates by Demographic

## Question 1 - Race or ethnicity

**Directions for Questions 1-3:** For each demographic below (i.e., race or ethnicity, gender, age group), what percentage of students enrolled in your course(s) fall into each category?

As you fill in the tables below with your percentages, **please keep in mind which demographics in your course are higher or lower compared to your overall college.**

### Academic term: 2023/2024 (Fall 2023 & Spring 2024)

**Directions for Questions 4-6:** Looking at the demographic breakdown of students enrolled in your course(s) compared to the students at your college, please answer the following open-ended questions. Please note that these questions are intended for you to share your observations. There are no right or wrong answers.

## Question 4

a. Which ethnic or racial groups at your institution are underrepresented in your courses?

> What is the cutoff value for the underrepresented? If I average out, then it comes to 12.5. Filipinos, multi-ethnic, African American or Black, and Pacific Islander groups are underrepresented.

b. Why do you think this underrepresentation exists?

c. Do you know of any systemic barriers impacting access for underrepresented groups?

> Answers to b & c: Most blacks in STEM positions consider major underlying reasons for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in science, technology, engineering and math occupations to be limited access to quality education, discrimination in recruitment and promotions and a lack of encouragement to pursue these jobs from an early age.

## Question 5

a. After analyzing your course enrollments, what follow-up questions do you have?

> The enrollment data provides an overview of the student population. A notable difference exists between the male and female populations, with males being the dominant group. 

b. What else would you like to know about your students?

> I would like to know how many students are veterans.

c. What next steps could you take to obtain the answers to your questions?

> Read the literature to find out why male is dominated over females in STEM. Secondly input veteran information, which I am sure is collected in the enrollment process. Add this information in the system.

## Question 6

a. How could you use demographic data regarding the local community, the college, and your classes to review the choices you made regarding texts/readings, assignments, and assessments?

> I strongly support providing no-cost course resources such as OER content, open-source software, and a laptop loan program. Additionally, I offer flexible assignment deadlines for students who work and have other commitments.

b. What information, support, or training would you need to increase the enrollment of underrepresented student groups in your classes?

> The enrollment data indicates that the overall trend among underrepresented groups at the college is low. This low enrollment also affects the CISC courses, reflecting a broader issue. I believe that addressing this situation requires systemic change starting from the grassroots level. However, I am uncertain if training would effectively enhance the enrollment of underrepresented populations.

# Part 2: Course retention rates by demographics

## Question 7 - Race or ethnicity

**Retention rate threshold is 90%**

**Directions for Questions 7-9:** For each demographic below, **what percentage of students enrolled in your course(s) did not withdraw and received a valid grade** (i.e., course retention rate)? A valid grade is typically any grade A-F, Passing or Not Passing.

As you fill in the tables below with your percentages**,** please keep in mind which demographics in your course are higher or lower compared to your overall college.

**Directions for Questions 10-12:** Looking at the course retention rates of students enrolled in your course compared to the students at your college, please answer the following open-ended questions. Please note that these questions are intended for you to share your observations. There are no right or wrong answers.

## Question 10

a. Which ethnic or racial groups at your institution experience relatively lower retention rates in your courses?

> Based on the 90% threshold, the multi-ethnic and Latinx population is just under 90%

b. Why do you think this pattern exists?

> The data is inconclusive to identify patterns.

c. Do you know of any systemic barriers impacting course retention for these groups?

> The literature review highlights several systemic barriers encountered by the Latinx population, such as financial constraints, family responsibilities, limited support from teachers, peer pressure, and systemic discrimination. However, it's encouraging to note that, despite these challenges, the retention rate for multi-ethnic and Latinx students in CISC courses is nearing an impressive 90%. This suggests that with continued support and resources, we can further enhance these positive outcomes.

## Question 11

a. After analyzing your course retention rates, what follow-up questions do you have?

> Why is the retention rate of the Latinx population lower in CISC courses compared to the overall Latinx population at the college?

b. What else would you like to know about your students?

> Identifying the reasons why students leave the course is crucial for us to offer tailored support that can help them succeed.

c. What next steps could you take to obtain the answers to your questions?

> Develop a constructive feedback questionnaire to collect valuable insights from students who are withdrawing from the course. This will help us understand their reasons and improve the program for future participants.

## Question 12

a. Are you interested in increasing the retention rates of a specific demographic?

b. If so, what information, support, or training would you need to help you increase that demographic’s retention rates?

> The data shows that the retention rate for the Latinx population is slightly below 90%. According to the response from question 11c, I should be able to determine my next steps. For instance, if there is a financial hardship, I will reach out to the appropriate person in Student Services for assistance.

c. What would be your next steps?

> Already answered above.

# Part 3: Course success rates by demographic

## Question 13 - Race or ethnicity

**Retention rate threshold is 78%**

**Directions for Questions 13-15:** For each demographic below, **what percentage of students enrolled in your course(s) earned a passing or satisfactory grade** (i.e., course success rate)? A passing grade is typically any grade A-C or “Pass.”


As you fill in the tables below with your percentages**,** please keep in mind which demographics in your course are higher or lower compared to your overall college.

**Directions for Questions 16-19:** Looking at the course retention and success rates of students enrolled in your course compared to your college overall, please answer the following open-ended questions. Please note that these questions are intended for you to share your observations. There are no right or wrong answers.

## Question 16

a. Which ethnic or racial groups at your institution experience relatively lower success rates in your courses?

> Multi-ethnic, Black/African-American, and Latinx groups.

b. Why do you think this pattern exists?

> Probably due to systemic barriers to these groups.

c. Do you know of any systemic barriers impacting course success for these student groups?

> Possibly due to financial constraints, family responsibilities, limited support from teachers, peer pressure, and systemic discrimination, some students may underperform. It would be beneficial for teachers to gather information from these underperforming students to help develop new strategies and plans that better support them.

## Question 17

a. Do you have any demographics with a high retention rate, but low success rate?

b. Conversely, do you have any demographics with a low retention rate, but high success rate?
