**Directions for Questions 4-6:** Looking at the demographic breakdown of students enrolled in your course(s) compared to the students at your college, please answer the following open-ended questions. Please note that these questions are intended for you to share your observations. There are no right or wrong answers.

## Question 4

a. Which ethnic or racial groups at your institution are underrepresented in your courses?

> African American or Black, Hispanic, and Pacific Islander.

b. Why do you think this underrepresentation exists?

> Based on my observation, such students have financial responsibilities and are busy working for the family.

c. Do you know of any systemic barriers impacting access for underrepresented groups?

> As mentioned above, economic reasons are one of the main barriers to accessing education.

## Question 5

a. After analyzing your course enrollments, what follow-up questions do you have?

> The enrollment data provides an overview of the student population. A notable difference exists between the male and female populations, with males being the dominant group. I would like to understand the reasons behind this disparity.

b. What else would you like to know about your students?

> What are the barriers to female education?

c. What next steps could you take to obtain the answers to your questions?

> More research is needed to determine the barriers to female education. Check if there is any recent study after COVID has been done.

## Question 6

a. How could you use demographic data regarding the local community, the college, and your classes to review the choices you made regarding texts/readings, assignments, and assessments?

> I strongly support providing no-cost course resources such as OER content, open-source software, and a laptop loan program. Additionally, I offer flexible assignment deadlines for students who work and have other commitments.

b. What information, support, or training would you need to increase the enrollment of underrepresented student groups in your classes?

> Based on the enrollment data, the general enrollment trend among underrepresented groups is low throughout the college. The CISC courses also see the ripple effect of low enrollment among underrepresented groups. Schedule open days and showcase hands-on activities to the community to create excitement, setup computer game consoles are few examples.

## Question 7

**Directions for Questions 7-9:** For each demographic below, **what percentage of students enrolled in your course(s) did not withdraw and received a valid grade** (i.e., course retention rate)? A valid grade is typically any grade A-F, Passing or Not Passing.

As you fill in the tables below with your percentages**,** please keep in mind which demographics in your course are higher or lower compared to your overall college.

**Directions for Questions 10-12:** Looking at the course retention rates of students enrolled in your course compared to the students at your college, please answer the following open-ended questions. Please note that these questions are intended for you to share your observations. There are no right or wrong answers.

## Question 10

a. Which ethnic or racial groups at your institution experience relatively lower retention rates in your courses?

> Retention rate of one course versus retention rate for the entire college is like comparing apples to oranges. Performing statistical analysis of low N versus high N will give fluctuations in the result. In my spring 2024, CISC 211 class, there were 134 students as compared to over 27k students for the entire college. In addition, Computer Science courses are generally required hard skills and require prior knowledge of computers

b. Why do you think this pattern exists?

c. Do you know of any systemic barriers impacting course retention for these groups?

## Question 11

a. After analyzing your course retention rates, what follow-up questions do you have?

b. What else would you like to know about your students?

c. What next steps could you take to obtain the answers to your questions?

## Question 12

a. Are you interested in increasing the retention rates of a specific demographic?

b. If so, what information, support, or training would you need to help you increase that demographic’s retention rates?

c. What would be your next steps?

## Question 13

**Directions for Questions 13-15:** For each demographic below, **what percentage of students enrolled in your course(s) earned a passing or satisfactory grade** (i.e., course success rate)? A passing grade is typically any grade A-C or “Pass.”


As you fill in the tables below with your percentages**,** please keep in mind which demographics in your course are higher or lower compared to your overall college.

**Directions for Questions 16-19:** Looking at the course retention and success rates of students enrolled in your course compared to your college overall, please answer the following open-ended questions. Please note that these questions are intended for you to share your observations. There are no right or wrong answers.

## Question 16

a. Which ethnic or racial groups at your institution experience relatively lower success rates in your courses?

b. Why do you think this pattern exists?

c. Do you know of any systemic barriers impacting course success for these student groups?

## Question 17

a. Do you have any demographics with a high retention rate, but low success rate?

b. Conversely, do you have any demographics with a low retention rate, but high success rate?

c. If so, why do you think these trends exist?

## Question 18

a. After analyzing your course success rates, what follow-up questions do you have?

b. What else would you like to know about your students?

c. What next steps could you take to obtain the answers to your questions?

## Question 19

a. Are you interested in increasing the course success rates of a specific demographic?

b. If so, what information, support, or training would you need to help you increase that demographic’s success rates?

# Longitudinal analysis

In this section, you will review enrollment, retention, and success for courses that you have taught for **more than one term.** Prior to starting, you may meet with your institutional researcher(s) to determine what course data is available for you to analyze.

If you have **not** taught more than one term, **enter “N/A” for all questions in this section.**

## Question 20

a. Do you see differences in enrollments, course retention, and course success/completion due to your **course format** (e.g., fully on campus/in-person, fully online, or hybrid)?

b. Why do you think these trends exist?

## Question 21

a. What do you think is the ideal balance between online (virtual) courses and in-person courses for students?

b. Which student groups might benefit from access to online courses?

c. Which student groups might benefit from access to in-person courses?

## Question 22

a. Do you see differences in enrollments, course retention, and course success/completion between **different terms**? For example, do your courses have higher attendance in the spring term compared to the fall term?

b. Are you surprised by any of these trends, or are they what you expected?

c. Why do you think these trends exist?

## Question 23

a. Do you see differences in enrollments, course retention, and course success/completion when the course is offered in the **evening versus in the morning or in the afternoon**?

b. Are you surprised by any of these trends, or are they what you expected?

c. Why do you think these trends exist?

## Question 24

a. Do you see differences in enrollments, course retention, and course success/completion depending on **different course lengths** (e.g., 4-week intersession, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks)?

b. Are you surprised by any of these trends, or are they what you expected?

c. Why do you think these trends exist?
