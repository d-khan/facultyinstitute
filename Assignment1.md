**Directions for Questions 4-6:** Looking at the demographic breakdown of students enrolled in your course(s) compared to the students at your college, please answer the following open-ended questions. Please note that these questions are intended for you to share your observations. There are no right or wrong answers.

## Question 4

a. Which ethnic or racial groups at your institution are underrepresented in your courses?

> African American or Black, Hispanic, and Pacific Islander.

b. Why do you think this underrepresentation exists?

> Based on my observation, such students have financial responsibilities and are busy working for the family.

c. Do you know of any systemic barriers impacting access for underrepresented groups?

> As mentioned above, economic reasons are one of the main barriers to accessing education.

## Question 5

a. After analyzing your course enrollments, what follow-up questions do you have?

> The enrollment data provides an overview of the student population. A notable difference exists between the male and female populations, with males being the dominant group. I would like to understand the reasons behind this disparity.

b. What else would you like to know about your students?

> What are the barriers to female education?

c. What next steps could you take to obtain the answers to your questions?

> More research is needed to determine the barriers to female education. Check if there is any recent study after COVID has been done.

## Question 6

a. How could you use demographic data regarding the local community, the college, and your classes to review the choices you made regarding texts/readings, assignments, and assessments?

> I strongly support providing no-cost course resources such as OER content, open-source software, and a laptop loan program. Additionally, I offer flexible assignment deadlines for students who work and have other commitments.

b. What information, support, or training would you need to increase the enrollment of underrepresented student groups in your classes?

> Based on the enrollment data, the general enrollment trend among underrepresented groups is low throughout the college. The CISC courses also see the ripple effect of low enrollment among underrepresented groups. Schedule open days and showcase hands-on activities to the community to create excitement, setup computer game consoles are few examples.

## Question 7 - Race or ethnicity

**Directions for Questions 7-9:** For each demographic below, **what percentage of students enrolled in your course(s) did not withdraw and received a valid grade** (i.e., course retention rate)? A valid grade is typically any grade A-F, Passing or Not Passing.

As you fill in the tables below with your percentages**,** please keep in mind which demographics in your course are higher or lower compared to your overall college.

**Directions for Questions 10-12:** Looking at the course retention rates of students enrolled in your course compared to the students at your college, please answer the following open-ended questions. Please note that these questions are intended for you to share your observations. There are no right or wrong answers.

## Question 10

a. Which ethnic or racial groups at your institution experience relatively lower retention rates in your courses?

> Retention rate of one course versus retention rate for the entire college is like comparing apples to oranges. Performing statistical analysis of low N versus high N will give fluctuations in the result. In my spring 2024, CISC 211 class, there were 134 students as compared to over 27k students for the entire college. In addition, Computer Science courses are generally required hard skills and require prior knowledge of computers

b. Why do you think this pattern exists?

c. Do you know of any systemic barriers impacting course retention for these groups?

## Question 11

a. After analyzing your course retention rates, what follow-up questions do you have?

b. What else would you like to know about your students?

c. What next steps could you take to obtain the answers to your questions?

## Question 12

a. Are you interested in increasing the retention rates of a specific demographic?

b. If so, what information, support, or training would you need to help you increase that demographic’s retention rates?

c. What would be your next steps?

# Part 3: Course success rates by demographic

## Question 13 - Race or ethnicity

**Directions for Questions 13-15:** For each demographic below, **what percentage of students enrolled in your course(s) earned a passing or satisfactory grade** (i.e., course success rate)? A passing grade is typically any grade A-C or “Pass.”


As you fill in the tables below with your percentages**,** please keep in mind which demographics in your course are higher or lower compared to your overall college.
